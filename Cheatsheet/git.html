    <div id="introduction">
      <h2>Git Fundamentals</h2>
      <p><strong>Three locations:</strong> Working directory, index, repository. <br/>Git commands copy files between these locations</p>
      <p>the repository is a sort of online directory when you are working on a project with multiple people, you can put your local files to the repository (thanks to the "commit" command and the "push" command)
       then, everyone can get your files or your modifications (by using the "pull" command). <br/> <strong>The Working Directory</strong>
       is the specific folder where you're working on your own pc. The goal is to share it on the <strong>REPOSITORY</strong>
       (online plateform for sharing project)</p>
     </div>

       <h3>The process</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open CMD</li>
          <li>Go to the directory that you want to share by command "cd 'name of dir'..."</li>
          <li>We have to tell Git where the "root" of the repository is, for that type "git init": <br/>A hidden folder will appear on the working directory :<br/><br/><img src="githide.png" alt="hidenfolder"></li><br/>
          <li>Then type "git status" as you can see no commit has been commited yet:<br/>The red text is the file who aren't prepared to be commited: <br/><br/><img src="gitstatus.png" alt="git status"></li><br/>
          <li>For copying the file from the directory to the queue for the commit type "git add name of the file.ext". Nothing change, it's normal. </li>
          <li>Type again "git status" the file is green, now we can commit the directory <br/><br/><img src="gitstatus2.png" alt="git status 2"></li><br/>
          <li>To commit the file from the working directory to the local repository "git commit -m "your comment":Nothing happen, it's normal. The file is now commited.<br/><br/><img src="gitcommit.png" alt="git commit succefully"></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="Git_Push">
      <h3>Git push</h3>
        <p>Before the pushing to the online repository, we have to configure the local repository</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After creating a acount on github, return to CMD and type: git remote add origin https://github.com/user/poco-yourname.git (with your own id)</li>
          <li>Optional: Type git remote -v to verify all your configurations already done in the same directory. <br/><br/> <img src="gitremote.png" alt="Git Remote"></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Push comit to Github</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>git push -u origin master - <strong>first time</strong></li>
            <li>git push - <strong>after that</strong></li>
          </ul>
